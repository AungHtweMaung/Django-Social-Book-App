get_user_model()
-------------------
If you reference User directly (for example, by referring to it in a foreign key), your code will not work in projects where the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting has been changed to a different user model.

get_user_model()
Instead of referring to User directly, you should reference the user model using django.contrib.auth.get_user_model(). This method will return the currently active user model – the custom user model if one is specified, or User otherwise.

When you define a foreign key or many-to-many relations to the user model, you should specify the custom model using the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting. For example:  

UUID
-------
UUID, Universal Unique Identifier, is a python library which helps in generating random objects of 128 bits as ids.
models ထဲမှာရှိတဲ့ object တွေအတွက် unique ids တွေဖော်ပြချင်တဲ့အခါ UUID ကိုသုံးတယ်
UUID will generate unique id for particular django objects.
Universally unique identifiers are a good alternative to AutoField for primary_key. 
The database will not generate the UUID for you, so it is recommended to use default.
